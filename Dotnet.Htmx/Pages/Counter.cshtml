    # Counters!

    We retrieved a static HTML snippet in the previous sample and replaced an element on the page, but what about maintaining the application state? We'll increment a counter on the server in this sample while updating our UI to reflect the change.  This time around, we'll use the `POST` action to show that HTMX supports most HTTP methods.

    To accomplish the incrementing feature, we'll need to modify the following `button`. Similar to our `Hello, World` sample, it's a matter of a few attributes. The only difference is that we have a bit more server-side logic involved in maintaining the current count in this case.

<div class="card p-5 mb-4">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
        <div>
            <!-- change the button -->
            <button class="btn btn-primary"
                    hx-post=""
                    hx-target="#example_one_count">
                <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i>
                Increment
            </button>

        <div>
